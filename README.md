Introduction:
Brain cancer stands as one of the most life-threatening illnesses globally. However, the diagnostic process for brain tumors is often time-consuming, delaying crucial interventions. Leveraging image classification techniques holds the potential to revolutionize brain tumor detection, ensuring a faster and more efficient diagnosis. By implementing advanced image analysis algorithms, we aim to expedite the identification of brain tumors, providing patients with quicker insights into their condition. This acceleration in diagnosis not only enhances the chances of timely medical intervention but also contributes to the overall improvement of patient outcomes and treatment success rates.
